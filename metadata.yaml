description: "The Education of Henry Adams is an autobiography that records the struggle\
  \ of Bostonian Henry Adams (1838â€“1918), in his later years, to come to terms with\
  \ the dawning 20th century, so different from the world of his youth. It is also\
  \ a sharp critique of 19th-century educational theory and practice. In 1907, Adams\
  \ began privately circulating copies of a limited edition printed at his own expense.\
  \ Commercial publication of the book had to await its author's 1918 death, whereupon\
  \ it won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize. The Modern Library placed it first in a list of\
  \ the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century.\n From Wikipedia\
